# Modified By Marije
This is a modified install of pterodactyl. This is an install i use personally but i dont mind it being open source so therefore it is publically avalible. Currently only mild visual changes are being made so i dont have to apply them every time i update my server using this package.

If you are looking for the official pterodactyl panel install please head over to https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel instead.

Current planned features for this fork:
* Plugin manager connected to the panel
* Permission manager via LuckPerms intergrated into the panel
* Server statistics visible in the panel
* Clustered minecraft server (for scalable instances like minigames, lobbies and whatever else you can think of)
* More native support for other installs i prioritize (discord bots, valheim, rust)
* automatic port forwarding in the firewall/(router?)
* DNS management
* Possibly support for website hosting or specific types of websites such as nextcloud
* Whatever else i want to add to the panel

Overall this install of pterodactyl will be more focussed on big public servers that mostly run minigames.
Since i am a team of 1 and a beginner programmer (but a fast learner) it might take a while to implement these features. Feel free to collaborate or do other suggestions that could be useful in this install

I am aware there are paid options that add some of these features but i find them to often be overpriced and i want to offer a free option and mabye even a better option.
